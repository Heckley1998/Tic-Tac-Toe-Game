1. A python only project that is good for those at beginner level but looking for a challenge.
2. Software packages "turtle" and "math" both need to be imported at the beginning of the program code for it to work.
3. Best works with Repl.it in terms of graphic visualization for the game interface but can work on any text editor with the right software packages installed.
